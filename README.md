# Fashion MNIST Basic Neural Network Architectures
I have implemented a simple multi-layer perceptron neural network using PyTorch to solve a clothing classification problem with the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 10 classes with 60,000 examples in the training set and 10,000 examples in the test set.

Reported the depth effect of different hidden layers are reported. Analyzed the dropout technique and reported its results. Used batch normalization and reported its effects. The model is tested for L1 and L2 regularization.

For more info and the report, check the document.pdf file.
